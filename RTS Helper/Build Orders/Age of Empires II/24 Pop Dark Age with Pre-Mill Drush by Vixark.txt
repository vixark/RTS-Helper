|| 1 ||  {p=4}  [sc][>][explore]  /f  <r>4[f]  4[vs] || Use shift queuing to make the initial scout's scouting path. Since you'll also scout with sheep and won't push deer, it's ok to have less scoutting efficiency so you can focus in your economy. \n\n If you are in one side of the map, don't go twice behind your base at the edge of the map. Make one circle around your town center, moving closer to the edge of the map when near it, and then make a U shaped path around the first circle avoiding the edge of the map. \n\n If you are in a corner of the map, you usually spawn at a greater distance from the edges so making two circles with the scout is fine. \n\n The two layers of scoutting should be enough to find all your sheep and the first patch of deer. After that, you can manually task the scout to look for the second patch of deer if the sheeps haven't found it yet and to explore the opponent's town. \n\n For exploring the opponent's town faster and easier without running into the town center, you can use the mod 'Minimap TC Orbit' and make a scoutting path inside the circle.

|| 2 ||  {p=5}  [shp2][>][tc]   [shp]<xt>3-4<>[>][explore]  /f  <r>5[f]  5[vs] || Use shift queuing to make the sheep's scouting path. Make zig-zag paths after the area that the scout will explore. \n\n If you are in one side of the map, send two sheep to each side (use starting and newly found sheep). One sheep explore near the edge of the map and the other more towards the front, but not in the front because there's risk of being converted. \n\n If you are in a corner of the map, send one sheep to the corner and one to each side near the edge. \n\n You should look for the second patch of deer, secondary gold and relics. If you find that the second patch of deer is in a safe spot, you could plan to take it.

Shoot the boar twice and retreat to the opposite side of town center. Don't kill it next to the solid part of the town center (upper corner), kill it near the left, right or bottom corner so many villagers can gather food from it unrestricted. \n\n Make the lumber camp adjacent to the woodline. If possible, queue the lumber camp builder to a tree behind the lumber camp and the villager #8 to the other tree behind. \n\n You can consider making the lumber camp one tile away from woodline if you plan to put many lumberjacks early, but you'd have an inneficient lumber camp in middle feudal age. Usually it's better to open up the one tile gap to the woodline with the first three to four lumberjacks while you have the extra lumberjacks in efficient stragglers (two tiles away from town center). When the one tile gap is open, send the villagers in stragglers to the lumber camp, since it can now support efficiently many villagers.

If there's still more than 20 food in the boar, put the villagers on sheep in boar and then back to sheep. \n\n First, send the nine villagers to one deer. Then, while they are walking towards it, deselect three villagers using ctrl in the unit portrait area and send them to the second deer. And finally, deselect three more and send the remaining three to the last deer.

If you put the sheep next to the villagers' backs, they'll distribute better and all of them will be able to gather from it. If they still get stuck, select all shepherds and move them away from sheep for a second and back to sheep, they usually make room so all of them can gather food.

Hunting the second patch of deer is similar economically to keeping the same villagers in wood and then make farms with them. It won't delay your castle age timing, but it won't make it faster either. Its advantage is that it provides faster food income in mid feudal age for upgrades like fletching, horse collar, supplies and bloodlines or allows you to create more food heavy units like men-at-arms and scouts earlier. If the second patch of deer is in a very exposed area, safety should come first and it's better to leave those villagers in early farms.
