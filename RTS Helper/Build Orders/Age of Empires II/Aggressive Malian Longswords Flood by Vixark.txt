(([6][maa][>][ls]<xt>3<x>[rax]<>[>][champ]<xt>5<x>[rax]<>   <b>for [Malians] on [green arabia] [1s] 20 Pop<>   <b>Author:<> http://vixark.com/age-of-empires-ii:Vixark [1s] http://vixark.com/donate:Donate   <b>Difficulty:<> Moderate || An aggressive build order that gets three militias at 9:15 (same as 21 pop), upgrades them to men-at-arms at 9:55 (0:25 before 21 pop) and gets six men-at-arms at 10:58 (0:25 before 21 pop). \n\n Its drawbacks are that it has late loom at 11:45 (1:40 after 21 pop), late stone walling at 15:30-16:00 (1:00 after 21 pop) and weaker economy (150-200 resources less in feudal age than 21 pop). \n\n It also requires more attention to the army than 21 pop because you need to do damage to keep the opponent in their town in order to avoid attacks to your unwalled town and unloomed villagers. It also has some instructions that need a precise timing that may be difficult to meet if you are not a fast player. \n\n The main objective is to disturb your opponent with six men-at-arms while you stone wall your town and advance to castle age with a food heavy economy. \n\n Starting castle age you can have 14 long swordsmen with +5 pierce armor and squires around 22:00. The 14 long swordsmen can destroy a big mass of feudal archers and skirmishers, face a medium mass of crosbowmen, face six knights and destroy town centers if they're unguarded. \n\n Your economy is set up for producing long swordsmen constantly from three barracks and you can click up to imperial at 30:00 to get the third armor and two-handed swordsman upgrades power spike and produce them constantly from five barracks. \n\n It's good vs. archers if you can wall up without receiving much damage. It can be risky vs. scouts. ))

|| 1 ||  {p=4}  [sc][>][explore]  /f  <r>4[f]  4[vs] || Use shift queuing to make the initial scout's scouting path. Since you'll also scout with sheep and won't push deer, it's ok to have less scoutting efficiency so you can focus in your economy. \n\n If you are in one side of the map, don't go twice behind your base at the edge of the map. Make one circle around your town center, moving closer to the edge of the map when near it, and then make a U shaped path around the first circle avoiding the edge of the map. \n\n If you are in a corner of the map, you usually spawn at a greater distance from the edges so making two circles with the scout is fine. \n\n The two layers of scoutting should be enough to find all your sheep and the first patch of deer. After that, you can manually task the scout to look for the second patch of deer if the sheeps haven't found it yet and to explore the opponent's town. \n\n For exploring the opponent's town faster and easier without running into the town center, you can use the mod 'Minimap TC Orbit' and make a scoutting path inside the circle.

|| 2 ||  {p=5}  [shp2][>][tc]   [shp]<xt>3-4<>[>][explore]  /f  <r>5[f]  5[vs] || Use shift queuing to make the sheep's scouting path. Make zig-zag paths after the area that the scout will explore. \n\n If you are in one side of the map, send two sheep to each side (use starting and newly found sheep). One sheep explore near the edge of the map and the other more towards the front, but not in the front because there's risk of being converted. \n\n If you are in a corner of the map, send one sheep to the corner and one to each side near the edge. \n\n You should look for the second patch of deer, secondary gold and relics. If you find that the second patch of deer is in a safe spot, you could plan to take it.

Block the boar's path with villager #8 if the other villagers haven't finished yet. Don't kill it next to the solid part of the town center (upper corner), kill it near the left, right or bottom corner so many villagers can gather food from it unrestricted.

If possible, queue the lumber camp builder to a tree behind the lumber camp and the villager #10 to the other tree behind. \n\n You can consider making the lumber camp one tile away from woodline if you plan to put many lumberjacks early, but you'd have an inneficient lumber camp in middle feudal age. Usually it's better to open up the one tile gap to the woodline with the first three to four lumberjacks while you have the extra lumberjacks in efficient stragglers (two tiles away from town center). When the one tile gap is open, send the villagers in stragglers to the lumber camp, since it can now support efficiently many villagers.

Don't kill the boar next to the solid part of the town center (upper corner), kill it near the left, right or bottom corner so many villagers can gather food from it unrestricted. \n\n If you are in a map with elephants or rhinoceros, send a villager in the first one to the second one around 3:30.

|| 9 ||  {p=12}  Select [6][v@boarfh]  /f  <r>2[w]  10[f]  12[vs] || To select only six villagers with full health points, select all the villagers in boar and use ctrl in the portrait area to deselect the injured ones until you have six healthy villagers selected.

This step should be done quickly because they need to come back to the town center just in time for advancing to feudal age. \n\n The town center's gather point should be reset to boar #2 so the new villagers spawn near it.

|| 11 ||  {p=14}  [shp]<xt>3-8<>[>][tc]  /f  <r>2[w]  12[f]  14[vs] || Place the sheep close to the town center so they are safe of being converted by opponent's scout, but not so close that they interfere with villagers. Around the top corner of the town center could be a good spot for them.

If you put the sheep next to the villagers' backs, they'll distribute better and all of them will be able to gather from it. If they still get stuck, select all shepherds and move them away from sheep for a second and back to sheep, they usually make room so all of them can gather food. \n\n Since the build order is tight in food, the extra villager in berries is used as an extra 10 food income in case you can't advance with the sheep's food alone.

Versus archers, it could be better to send them to the front to disturb completely their gold income. Versus scouts, depending on how long is the wall needed and how much damage you can do with the first three men-at-arms, you can choose to make spears and men-at-arms to defend the wallers or send them to the front.

Read 'Stone Walling in One Town Center Push' in vixark.com/age-of-empires-ii. \n\n Connect woodlines with stone walls prioritizing diagonal segments. The diagonal segments cover more linear distance for the same stone. \n\n Don't be afraid to make a big walled area. If there's risk, protect the wallers with spearmen, men-at-arms and the scout. \n\n Try to have a safe woodline that can't be reached by opponent's archers, even if this means walling behind it. One safe woodline is enough until imperial age. \n\n In castle age the large stone walls are not only for safety, they are also for hiding your strategy while the opponent usually can't. If you see the opponent booming, you continue with this build order. But if you see the opponent preparing a defence for your long swordsmen, you are in a good position to boom and defend behind stone walls.
