Since you'll also scout with sheep and won't push deer, it's ok to have less scoutting efficiency so you can focus in your economy. \n\n If you are in one side of the map, don't go twice behind your base at the edge of the map. Make one circle around your town center, moving closer to the edge of the map when near it, and then make a U shaped path around the first circle avoiding the edge of the map. \n\n If you are in a corner of the map, you usually spawn at a greater distance from the edges so making two circles with the scout is fine. \n\n The two layers of scoutting should be enough to find all your sheep and the chickens. After that, you can manually task the scout to explore the opponent's town. \n\n For exploring the opponent's town faster and easier without running into the town center, you can use the mod 'Minimap TC Orbit' and make a scoutting path inside the circle. \n\n Use sheep #4 to explore in the surroundings of town center, use it only to help you find the first boar if the scout hasn't found it yet.

If they still get stuck, select all shepherds and move them away from the sheep for a second and then back to the sheep, they usually make room so all of them can gather food.

|| 5 ||  {p=8}  [50v@tc][>][vdshp][>][boar1]   [+v]   /f  <r>8[f]  8[vs] || Hunt the boar in your town's front to avoid laming. Shoot the boar once and retreat to the opposite side of town center. Don't kill it next to the solid part of the town center (upper corner), kill it near the left, right or bottom corner so many villagers can gather food from it unrestricted.

Queue the lumber camp builder to a tree behind the lumber camp and the villager #11 to the other tree behind. \n\n You can consider making the lumber camp one tile away from woodline if you plan to put many lumberjacks early, but you'd have an inneficient lumber camp in middle feudal age. Usually it's better to open up the one tile gap to the woodline with the first 3-4th lumberjacks while you have the extra lumberjacks in efficient stragglers (two tiles away from town center). When the one tile gap is open, send the villagers in stragglers to the lumber camp, since it can now support efficiently many villagers.
