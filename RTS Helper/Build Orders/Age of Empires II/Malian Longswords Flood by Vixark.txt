The 14 long swordsmen can destroy a big mass of feudal archers and skirmishers, face a medium mass of crosbowmen, face six knights and destroy town centers if they're unguarded. \n\n Your economy is set up for producing long swordsmen constantly from three barracks and you can click up to imperial at 30:00 to get the third armor and two-handed swordsman upgrades power spike and produce them constantly from five barracks. \n\n It's good vs. archers if you can wall up without receiving much damage. It can also work vs. scouts into knights if you can defend your villagers with spearmen and men-at-arms and distract in the opponent's town with other men-at-arms and create some spearmen/pikemen in castle age. ))

|| 1 ||  {p=4}  [sc][>][explore]  /f  <r>4[f]  4[vs] || Use shift queuing to make the initial scout's scouting path. Since you'll also scout with sheep and won't push deer, it's ok to have less scoutting efficiency so you can focus in your economy. \n\n If you are in one side of the map, don't go twice behind your base at the edge of the map. Make one circle around your town center, moving closer to the edge of the map when near it, and then make a U shaped path around the first circle avoiding the edge of the map. \n\n If you are in a corner of the map, you usually spawn at a greater distance from the edges so making two circles with the scout is fine. \n\n The two layers of scoutting should be enough to find all your sheep and the first patch of deer. After that, you can manually task the scout to look for the second patch of deer if the sheeps haven't found it yet and to explore the opponent's town. \n\n For exploring the opponent's town faster and easier without running into the town center, you can use the mod 'Minimap TC Orbit' and make a scoutting path inside the circle.

|| 2 ||  {p=5}  [shp2][>][tc]   [shp]<xt>3-4<>[>][explore]  /f  <r>5[f]  5[vs] || Use shift queuing to make the sheep's scouting path. Make zig-zag paths after the area that the scout will explore. \n\n If you are in one side of the map, send two sheep to each side (use starting and newly found sheep). One sheep explore near the edge of the map and the other more towards the front, but not in the front because there's risk of being converted. \n\n If you are in a corner of the map, send one sheep to the corner and one to each side near the edge. \n\n You should look for the second patch of deer, secondary gold and relics. If you find that the second patch of deer is in a safe spot, you could plan to take it.

If possible, queue the lumber camp builder to a tree behind the lumber camp and the villager #10 to the other tree behind. \n\n You can consider making the lumber camp one tile away from woodline if you plan to put many lumberjacks early, but you'd have an inneficient lumber camp in middle feudal age. Usually it's better to open up the one tile gap to the woodline with the first three to four lumberjacks while you have the extra lumberjacks in efficient stragglers (two tiles away from town center). When the one tile gap is open, send the villagers in stragglers to the lumber camp, since it can now support efficiently many villagers.

This step should be done quickly because they need to come back to the town center just in time for advancing to feudal age. \n\n Place the sheep close to the town center so they are safe of being converted by opponent's scout, but not so close that they interfere with villagers. Around the top corner of the town center could be a good spot for them.

Read 'Stone Walling in One Town Center Push' in vixark.com/age-of-empires-ii. \n\n Connect woodlines with stone walls prioritizing diagonal segments. The diagonal segments cover more linear distance for the same stone. \n\n Don't be afraid to make a big walled area. If there's risk, protect the wallers with spearmen, men-at-arms and the scout. \n\n Try to have a safe woodline that can't be reached by opponent's archers, even if this means walling behind it. One safe woodline is enough until imperial age. \n\n In castle age the large stone walls are not only for safety, they are also for hiding your strategy while the opponent usually can't. If you see the opponent booming, you continue with this build order. But if you see the opponent preparing a defence for your long swordsmen, you are in a good position to boom and defend behind stone walls.
